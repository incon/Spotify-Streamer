# Spotify Streamer
Discover songs using the Spotify API (Project 1 & 2 of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree).

Built an app, optimized for tablet, that displays an artist's top 10 tracks on Spotify. The user interface allows for search capability, displays a list of the top 10 tracks in a scrolling list complete with album art, and provides streaming playback of audio using Android's mediaplayer API.
